# Cosmetics Store

A simple web project demonstrating an online cosmetics catalog with a shopping cart. Product data is loaded from the public API.

## How to open

1. Ensure you have a modern web browser and internet access.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the catalog.
3. Open `cart.html` to see items added to the cart.

The pages do not require a server; they can be opened directly from the filesystem as long as network requests to dummyjson.com are allowed.

## Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Active internet connection (to fetch product information)
